# Reinforcement-Learning-Specialization
This repository is dedicated to the assignments of the Reinforcement Learning Specialization course by the university of the Alberta.
This is course is based on the "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" book by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton.
It should be noted that, most of the contents are created by the course authors, and I just wrote some parts of them.
Hope you enjoy, give feedback and help me to improve his repository.
